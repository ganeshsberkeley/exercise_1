This directory contains the PERL script that generates the SQL files needed transformng raw data into a set 0f tables

The script is sql_transform.pl

Please run the ./sql_transform.pl in the transforming window and it will generate all the sql files that are needed for transforming

Then invoke spark-sql from the linux prompt
Once we are in the sql env we need to load the table one by one

Also we can do spark-sql -i full.sql to load all the tables in one shot
